In GDS, we use [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com) to host our services. 

We follow the [Government Cloud First policy](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-cloud-first-policy) and use AWS managed cloud services and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solutions to host our services rather than using our own hardware.
